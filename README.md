# Control Flow in Python

### If, else if - elif, else statements (blocks)

- If statements check to see if a condition is true and if it is true then carry it will carry out the code within.
  For example in the code below the print statement will be executed if the statement is true.
- Elif statements work the same as the if statements but will only execute if the if statement is false.
- Else statements will execute if all the statements above it are false as the conditions are not met.

```
age = 14
# if the user is above the age of 15 allow them to buy a ticket
if age >= 15:  # if this condition is met/ true the print statement will be executed
    print("Thank you, please proceed with your purchase")

# if the user is under 15 years of age do not allowed to buy a ticket
elif age < 15:
    print("Sorry you are under age to watch this movie")

# else block is executed if none of the above conditions are met
else:
    print("Oops something went wrong, please try later")

```
